# Design 1 - Basic 'Arm' 

The idea for this design is something basic we can use to test that a simulation over the server can correctly and accurately fit a reward function. This should be a simpl 2-3 servo arm attached to the Jetson Nano base with a gyroscope or some heigh sensor attached to it. The `Goal` of this system will be to raise the arm as high as possible
